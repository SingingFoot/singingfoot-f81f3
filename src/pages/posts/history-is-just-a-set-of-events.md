History is just a set of events that neither of us has a rough idea of. Therefore, we must either be silent about history or say anything. This is what everyone does, and this ultimately leads to the cluttering of the historical narrative with legends and mystifications, which some people recognize on a par with the real facts, and others - even much better than the facts, because they are easier to build ideologies. 

Sifting out the real facts from the simulated ones is like building a tower out of dry sand during a raging hurricane. This work is impossible, useless, and even no one needs. There are also many people who are threatened by this tower, so they will destroy it at the first opportunity, even realizing that it will never and under no circumstances be built. 

And even if there was no hurricane wind and those who wanted to destroy the tower, the sand itself dissipates so quickly that you do not even have time to touch it. That is why this tower exists only in the imagination of certain people, but these people themselves quickly disappear. So fast that they do not have time to tell the idea of ​​this tower to others. 

This is only the idea of ​​the tower, not the possibility of its construction or certain methodologies to combat wind and dry sand, or attempts to prevent its destruction by dissatisfied with the tower, because the message of all these details would take too long - and those, who would listen to these details, would also have time to disappear without a trace, even without passing on fragments of their chaotic and erratic memories to descendants who would never be able to use them and would not even be able to understand what it is, because the language itself has changed and would be unrecognizable, and few people willing to decipher this absurd text about the impossibility of building a tower, because it makes no sense, because at a time when it was finally possible to convey these fragmentary messages about nothing, the idea of ​​building a tower was officially abandoned, not even knowing that once a handful of desperate enthusiasts and amateurs conducted special experiments on this topic.
