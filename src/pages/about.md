He is the author of the paradoxical novel **Kaharlyk** (2014, English translation - 2016). His second novel, **The First Ukrainian Robots** (2015), is a series of satirical sketches in the style of Monty Python and Stanislav Lem. Both novels were nominated for the national Shevchenko Prize in Literature by the Kharkiv Museum of Literature. Oleg Shinkarenko's third novel-pamphlet "Skull" (2017) is devoted to the study of the causes of Russian aggression against Ukraine. The fourth novel **Bandera Distortion** is about the transformation of [Stepan Bandera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepan_Bandera) image in the media and the consciousness of modern man. His collection of short stories **How to disappear completely** (2007) received the award of the publishing house "Smoloskyp".

*"The most consistent absurdist in modern Ukrainian literature"* created a podcast **Philosophical Drum** for Ukrainian Public Radio, which was attended by many local and foreign intellectuals. Shynkarenko writes articles and literary criticism for many Ukrainian media, as well as for [The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/author/oleg-shynkarenko) (New York), [Institute for War & Peace Reporting](https://iwpr.net/about/people/oleg-shynkarenko) (London) and [Future Challenges](https://blog.futurechallenges.org/local/author/oleg-shynkarenko/) (Hamburg).
